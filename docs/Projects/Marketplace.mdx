**Service** - changes logic behind retrieving information

You then override the retrieve method. In that method:
You check if the
loggedInUser*
is set. If not, you call the
retrieve
method of the service from the core package.
If the loggedInUser*
is set, you retrieve the store using a new method Copy to clipboard
retrieveForLoggedInUser
. This method retrieves the store using the value of Copy to clipboard
store*id
of the Copy to clipboard
loggedInUser*
and expands the Copy to clipboard
members
relation.
