                    <summary>**Explain `is()`, `not()` and `where()`**</summary>

```css
article:is(h1, h2, h3:not(aside h3), h4) {
  color: red
}

// same as 

article h1, article h2, article h3:not(aside h3), article h4 {
  color: red;
}
```

`not()` excludes that particular style

                    <summary>**Explain `has()`**</summary>

```css
ul:has(li:nth-child(6)) {
  columns: 2;
}

ul:has(li:nth-child(11)) {
  columns: 3;
}
```

`has()` is looking for patterns to match a given WebAssembly. Here we've made a list that conditionally changes for big and small lists.
