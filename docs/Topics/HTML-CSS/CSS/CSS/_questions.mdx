<summary>**What is CSS?**</summary>

CSS is a style sheet language used for formatting content in HTML webpages. CSS style sheets can define the appearance and formatting of text, tables, and other elements separately from the content itself. Styles may be found within a web pageâ€™s HTML file or in a separate document referenced by multiple webpages.
